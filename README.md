Boundary MongoDB Plugin
-----------------------
Collects metrics from a MongoDB server instance. MongoDB statistics are pulled via a REST API call. See video [walkthrough](https://help.boundary.com/hc/articles/201842211).

### Plugin Setup

The statistics are pulled from http://hostname:(port+1000)/_status.  If you did not change the MongoDB default port, we will use 28107.

1. Verify that you have access to the MongoDB statics by using curl by running the following command:
     ```bash
     $ curl http://localhost:28017/_status
     ```
2. If you cannot view the page, you may need to enable the [Mongo REST interface](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.http.RESTInterfaceEnabled)

3. If after enabling the Mongo REST interface, you are still unable to collect information from the REST interface and if you are polling remotely, ensure that the port that is serving the Mongo REST interfaces is open. You can bypasss any firewall restrictions by running locally where the MongoDB is running.
